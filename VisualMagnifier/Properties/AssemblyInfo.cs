[assembly: AssemblyDescription("The Pointing Magnifier is a target agnostic pointing technique designed to reduce the need for fine pointing. The mouse is replaced by a circle which can be moved freely about the screen. The area underneath the circle is magnified by clicking any mouse button. Once magnified, the normal mouse cursor appears in the center of the circle, allowing for traditional mouse operations from the magnified state.\r\n\r\nThe Pointing Magnifier is one of four techniques presented as part of the Enhanced Area Cursors (UIST 2010).\r\n\r\nLeah Findlater\r\nAlex Jansen, Developer\r\nKristen Shinohara\r\nMorgan Dixon\r\nPeter Kamb\r\nJoshua Rakita\r\nJacob O.
